This is a series of small articles / tutorials based around virtual memory. The goal is to learn some CS basics, but in a different and more practical way.

## TOC

### 00. C strings & `/proc`

For this first piece, we'll use `/proc` to find and modify variables (in this example, an ASCII string) contained inside the virtual memory of a running process, and learn some cool things along the way.

### 01. Python bytes

For this second piece, we'll do almost the same thing, but instead we will access the virtual memory of a running Python 3 script. It is not as straightfoward. Let's take this as an excuse to look at some Python 3 internals!

### 02. What's where in the virtual memory

Let's try to guess where things are in the virtual memory.

### 03. malloc, the heap and the program break

In this fourth chapter we will look at the heap and how malloc works in order to answer some of the questions we ended with at the end of the previous chapter.
